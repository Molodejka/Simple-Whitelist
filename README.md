# Simple-Whitelist
All what you need is script.lua & server.php <br /> 
Upload server.php to your hosting and change api link path to your site. <br /> 
Add keys like this { "name":"key" }. <br /> 
I also added crack.lua for cracking this script. <br /> 
# Dont use this for real scripts only for learning purposes. <br />
